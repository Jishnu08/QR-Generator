# QR Code Generator in Python

This repository contains a Python script for generating QR codes. It's a simple and efficient tool that allows you to easily create QR codes for various purposes, such as sharing website links, contact information, Wi-Fi credentials, or any other text-based data.

## Features

* **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface.
* **Customizable:** Allows you to specify the data to be encoded.
* **Output Options:** Saves the generated QR code as a PNG image.
* **Dependency-Free (Mostly):** Relies on the popular `qrcode` library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **qrcode Library:** Install the necessary library using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install qrcode
    ```
* **Pillow (PIL):** This library is used for image manipulation by `qrcode`. Install it if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd qr-code-generator-python
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository)

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py <data> [output_filename.png]
    ```
    * `<data>`: The text or URL you want to encode in the QR code.
    * `[output_filename.png]` (optional): The name you want to give to the output PNG file. If not specified, it will default to `qrcode.png`.

### Examples

* **Generate a QR code for a website:**
    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)" website_qr.png
    ```
    This will create a file named `website_qr.png` containing the QR code for `https://www.example.com`.

* **Generate a QR code for text:**
    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py "Hello, QR Code!" hello_qr.png
    ```
    This will create a file named `hello_qr.png` containing the QR code for the text "Hello, QR Code!".

* **Generate a QR code with the default filename:**
    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py "Another example"
    ```
    This will create a file named `qrcode.png`.
